⚠️ **DO NOT USE THIS REPO TO SECURE ANY AMOUNT OF MONEY. IT IS ARCHIVED AND FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.** ⚠️

A simple utility for creating [high entropy](http://www.contravex.com/2014/03/14/on-making-high-entropy-bitcoin-paper-wallets/) bitcoin private keys.

## Usage:

Only generate keys on an offline computer. At the most basic level, run an Ubuntu LiveUSB ([instructions](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu)). A more advanced user should use an airgapped machine. Follow Mircea Popescu's ["How to airgap. A practical guide."](http://trilema.com/2013/how-to-airgap-a-practical-guide/)

*A $ at the beginning of a command means you enter it in the terminal. Do not actually type the $.*

1. In the terminal: `$ unset HISTFILE`. This will disable bash history to prevent any data being left in the shell.
2. Roll 5 six-sided [casino dice](http://www.amazon.com/Trademark-Poker-Grade-Serialized-Casino/dp/B000RQ0GLU/) at least 6 times (each roll adds one word, equal to [12.9 bits of entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diceware))
3. With each roll append the results in the command line, like so: `$ python main.py 351456135165132154654651324654321324646312654651321654632165`
4. Print or write down the back up phrase contained within the single quotes
5. Optionally, import the private key into your favorite wallet software
6. To re-enable shell history, enter: `$ set HISTFILE`


## Deterministic addresses:

Entropic allows you to create deterministic keys based on your back up phrase. Use the `-n` or `--numaddrs` option to specify how many keys to make. For example:

`$ python main.py 351456135165132154654651324654321324646312654651321654632165 -n 3`

This would produce 3 private keys based on the following phrases:

* 'ka toast yh busy pugh ewe gulf puck avail yh chump guyana'
* 'ka toast yh busy pugh ewe gulf puck avail yh chump guyana1'
* 'ka toast yh busy pugh ewe gulf puck avail yh chump guyana2'

## Salt:

> In cryptography, a salt is random data that is used as an additional input to a one-way function that hashes a password or passphrase. The primary function of salts is to defend against dictionary attacks versus a list of password hashes and against pre-computed rainbow table attacks.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)

Since a sufficiently strong diceware passphrase inherently protects the user from dictionary attacks, a salt is unnecessary for these purposes. However, a salt can be useful for adding other security protections. By adding a easy to remember salt to a diceware wallet, a user can protect his bitcoins even in the case of the passphrase being revealed to another person, because the keys will not be accessible without also adding the salt.

When a salt is used, the key is generated by producing a SHA-256 hash of the passphrase concatenated with the salt: `sha(passphrase + salt)` A salt can be added using the `-s` or `--s` flag. Using the above example, the user might decide to use an email address as a salt:

`$ python main.py 351456135165132154654651324654321324646312654651321654632165 -n 3 -s test@example.com`

This would produce 3 private keys based on the following phrases:

* 'ka toast yh busy pugh ewe gulf puck avail yh chump guyana test@example.com'
* 'ka toast yh busy pugh ewe gulf puck avail yh chump guyana test@example.com1'
* 'ka toast yh busy pugh ewe gulf puck avail yh chump guyana test@example.com2'

An attacker would need to access the original phrase *and* the salt, which the user might choose to write down somewhere else or just remember.

**If you decide to use a salt, choose something that is simple and easy to remember, especially if you choose to not write it down.**

When using the `-s` flag, quotation marks are optional, unless your salt includes a space. If you wish to use a quotation mark in the salt, use an escape character: `\"` or `\'`.
